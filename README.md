## Week 5 Moronic Monday

### Forms
- [x] Can we review form_for again (also it's use in conjunction with validations)?
- [x] Can you explain again what's happening in this line? <div class="field"<%= ' field_with_errors' if @post.errors[:content].any? %>"> ...
- [x] Where does the form_tag path need to point to? The examples always have it pointing to an index path even though it's loading a form for new or edit routes. Does it matter since it's just loading a form?
- [x] Can we unpack how Patch works

### Crud
- [x] What would the SQL statement for a "new" action look like? I think it's technically a 'get' method, but what would you be selecting?
- [x] What is the difference between delete and destroy?

### Nested Associations
- [ ] Can we go over the Forms and Basic Association labs (the one with Song, Artist, Genre, Note)? There are a lot of moving parts that I can't seem to replicate correctly from previous examples.
- [ ] How do you display data from associated models that are nested.
